# MKDocs-Template

My preferred defaults and a template for MKDocs, which is also my preferred engine for writing documentation.

# Setup

If you're in a horribly hellish python environment like me (Sorry Sera, you know its true) make sure you use `pip3`

- `pip(3) install mkdocs`

- `git init`
- `git pull https://github.com/zkldi/mkdocs-template`
- `pip(3) install mkdocs-material`
- `mkdocs serve`

# About

`mkdocs-material` is a beautiful theme to work with and look at. The rest is just a file structure I like and some sensible defaults.
